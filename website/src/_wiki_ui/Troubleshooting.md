Then paste the information in your message.        


## Logs
To help us quickly pinpoint an issue, first delete all the old log files from the folders below. Then run the Pipeline, make the problem happen, and exit the Pipeline. And then send us the newly-created log files from the same folders.

### Windows

All the files in these two folders:

* `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\pipeline-ui\pipeline-logs\`
* `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\pipeline-ui\logs`

### macOS

All the files in these two folders:

* `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/pipeline-ui/pipeline-logs`
* `/Users/<username>/Library/Logs/pipeline-ui`

Where `<username>` is the username of the logged-in user on your computer.

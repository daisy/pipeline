# User Guide

DAISY Pipeline 2 is an umbrella term for various things.

- DAISY Pipeline 2 is a [desktop
  application](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-ui/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide/).

- DAISY Pipeline 2 can also be run as a [service](Pipeline-as-Service)
  to which client programs can connect, through a web API.

- The DAISY Pipeline 2 [web
  application](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-webui/wiki/User-Guide/)
  is an example of such a server-client configuration. Unlike with the
  desktop application, multiple users can work together in the same
  application, each through their own web browser, while the real work
  happens on a central server. The web application offers some
  additional features that are not available in the desktop
  application yet, such as
  "[templates](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-webui/wiki/Templating/)".

- There is also a [command line tool](Command-Line).

DAISY Pipeline 2, in all its forms, is supported on Windows, Mac OS,
and Linux.

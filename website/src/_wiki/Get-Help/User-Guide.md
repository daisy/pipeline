# User Guide

DAISY Pipeline 2 is an umbrella term for various things.

- DAISY Pipeline 2 is a [desktop
  application](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-ui/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide/)
  for Windows and macOS.

- It is a [web server](Pipeline-as-Service) to which client programs
  can connect through a RESTful API.

- The DAISY Pipeline 2 [web
  application](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-webui/wiki/User-Guide/)
  is an example of such a server-client configuration. Unlike with the
  desktop application, multiple users can work together in the same
  application, each through their own web browser, while the actual
  processing happens on a central server. The web application offers
  some additional features that are not available in the desktop
  application, such as
  "[templates](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-webui/wiki/Templating/)".

- There is also a [command line interface](Command-Line).

- DAISY Pipeline 2 is a [Java library](API-Documentation#java-api).

- For Windows users, there is also the [Save As DAISY addin for MS
  Word](https://daisy.org/activities/software/save-as-daisy-ms-word-add-in/),
  which is becoming a DAISY Pipeline user interface specifically for
  processing Word documents.

- "DAISY Pipeline" could also refer to the predecessor of DAISY
  Pipeline 2 which we now call "Pipeline 1". Because a lot of
  organisations still rely on some Pipeline 1 converters in their
  production today, we are currently working on making these legacy
  converters available through the DAISY Pipeline 2 user and
  programming interfaces, in order to make the transition to Pipeline
  2 smoother and to retire the Pipeline 1 user interface.

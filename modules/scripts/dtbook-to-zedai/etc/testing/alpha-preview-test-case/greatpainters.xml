							profit by this new arrangement to which he was forced to submit, he
							added fifteen hundred and twenty-four ducats to the four thousand he had
							received, to pay with his own gains for the works confided to the other
							artists.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp42" id="dtb39">Having thus terminated
							this unfortunate affair, which had caused him so much worry and fatigue,
							Michael Angelo was at last enabled to occupy himself exclusively with
							the execution of his <em>Last Judgment</em>, to which he devoted no less
							than eight to nine years.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp43" id="dtb40">This immense and unique
							picture, in which the human figure is represented in all possible
							attitudes, where every sentiment, every passion, every reflection of
							thought, and every aspiration of the soul are rendered with inimitable
							perfection, has never been equalled and never will be equalled in the
							domain of Art.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp44" id="dtb41">This time the genius of
							Michael Angelo simply attacked the infinite. </sent><sent
							smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp45" id="dtb42">The subject of this vast
							composition, the manner in which it is conceived and executed, the
							admirable variety and the learned disposition of the groups, the
							inconceivable boldness and firmness of the outlines, the contrast of
							light and shade, the difficulties, I might almost say the
							impossibilities vanquished, as if it were all mere play, and with a
							happiness that savours of prodigy, the unity of the whole and the
							perfection of the details, make <em>The Last Judgment</em> the most
							complete and the greatest picture in existence. </sent><sent id="dtb43"
							smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp46">It is broad and magnificent in
							effect, and yet each part of this prodigious painting gains infinitely
							when seen and studied quite near; and we do not know of any
							easel-picture worked upon with such patience and finished with such
							devotion.</sent></p>

					<p><sent id="dtb47" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp51">At the base of the

					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp57" id="dtb53">This first group, which

							triumph, other emblems of the divine expiation—the column, the ladder,
							and the sponge.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp68" id="dtb63">Above these angels, on

							the holy personages form this sixth group.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp69" id="dtb64">The seventh is the most

							the rebel angels. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp70"

					<p><sent id="dtb67" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp72">The eighth, ninth, and
							tenth groups, occupying the base of the composition, are composed, as we

							with all their might to convoke the dead from the four quarters of the

							Michael Angelo that he must cover them.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb78" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp83">Michael Angelo replied
							with his usual brusqueness:</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb79" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp84">"Tell the Pope that he

					<p><sent id="dtb80" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp86">It is said that Maestro
							Biaggio, master of ceremonies to Paul III., having accompanied the Pope
							on a visit that His Holiness made to see Michael Angelo's fresco when it
							was about half finished, allowed himself to express his own opinion upon
								<em>The Last Judgment</em>.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp87" id="dtb81">"Holy Father," said the
							good Messer Biaggio, "if I dare pronounce my judgment, this picture

							Pope."</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb82" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp88">Unfortunately for the

							smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp89">The Pope had scarcely gone before the
							irritated artist, wishing to make an example as a warning for all future
							critics, placed this Messer Biaggio in his hell, well and duly, under
							the scarcely flattering guise of Minos. </sent><sent id="dtb84"
							smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp90">That was always Dante's way when he

					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp91" id="dtb85">I leave you to imagine

							would have him taken out of hell: that was the most important thing.
							</sent><sent id="dtb87" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp93">As for the

							Messer Biaggio would leave that entirely to the high impartiality of the
							Holy Father.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb88" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp94">"Messer Biaggio," replied
							Paul III. with as much seriousness as he could maintain, "you know that

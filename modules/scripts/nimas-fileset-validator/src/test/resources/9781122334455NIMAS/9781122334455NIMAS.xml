                        During the 1920s, the United States saw a time of great prosperity. However, that would all
                        change with the stock market crash of 1929. The country and the world would be plunged into an
                        economic and social depression.

                    <p>
                        Companies were going bankrupt, banks were shutting down, and unemployment was skyrocketing.

                        One president would ignore the problem, another would radically alter the powers of government
                        to help the nation. People were starving both in the cities and on the farms of America.

                        Throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s, the people of the United States faced some of their
                        toughest years. Only the Second World War would put an end to The Great Depression.

                    <p>
                        Cities were hard hit by the Great Depression. By March of 1930, more than 3.2 million people
                        were unemployed. Since most people lost their homes, homelessness ran rampant. People were
                        living literally "in the streets." Whole families were living in boxes, under bridges and
                        overpasses, and in alleys. The street corners of New York City were packed with people selling
                        anything and everything to try and make money.
                        <q>"Desperate times began to put into question the old American notion that if a man worked hard
                            enough, he could always take care of himself and his family. The effect of the Depression on
                            poor children was particularly severe.... Most elderly Americans did not have personal
                            savings or retirement pensions to support them in normal times, let alone during a national
                            economic crisis.... Even skilled workers, business owners, successful farmers, and
                            professionals of all kinds found themselves in severe economic difficulty as one out of four
                            in the labor force lost their jobs." (CRF, www.crf-usa.org.)

                        People were living in the streets and they were starving. They were becoming angry and
                        desperate. Food riots broke out across the nation. In Minneapolis, people smashed the windows of
                        a store and stole fruit, canned goods, bacon, and ham. When one of the shop owners tried to stop
                        them at gunpoint, one of the looters broke his arm. It took 100 police officers to bring the
                        riot under control. Seven people were arrested.

                    <p>
                        Some cities tried to control the problem by distributing
                        food to people who waited in
                        <span class="keyword">bread lines</span>
                        to get a meal. In New York City, there were 82 different
                        bread lines located in different stations around the city.
                        In 1931, each of these lines averaged 85,000 meals a day.
                        A typical meal consisted of bread, soup, and stew. People
                        would stand in these lines for days waiting for one meal.
                        Many people fainted while standing in line from exhaustion,
                        fatigue, and hunger.

                        New York also tried to provide citywide relief to its homeless,
                        jobless masses. But by April of 1932, more than 750,000 New
                        Yorkers were dependent on city relief with a waiting list of
                        160,000 people. The people on relief began to outnumber the
                        people working. The city could not support this relief much longer.

                    <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in 1933 on his "new deal" platform of recovery and reform.
                        His inauguration speech contained the now-famous quote: "Let me assert my firm belief that the
                        only thing we have to fear is fear itself; needless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which
                        paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            FDR's Inaugural Address, 1933:
                            <br/>
                            President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: This is a day of national consecration, and
                            I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will
                            address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels.
                            This is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor
                            need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great nation will
                            endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So first of all let me assert my
                            firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning,
                            unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every
                            dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that
                            understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am
                            convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.
                        </p>
                        <p>In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank
                            God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels: taxes have risen, our
                            ability to pay has fallen, government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of
                            income, the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade, the withered leaves of
                            industrial enterprise lie on every side, farmers find no markets for their produce, the
                            savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.
                        </p>
                        <p>More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an
                            equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark
                            realities of the moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts.
                            Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not
                            afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human
                            efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes
                            in the very sight of the supply. Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of
                            mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have
                            admitted their failures and abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand
                            indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.
                        </p>
                        <p>True, they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn
                            tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money.
                            Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false
                            leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored conditions.
                            They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when
                            there is no vision the people perish.
                        </p>
                        <p>The money changers have fled their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now
                            restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent
                            to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.
                        </p>
                        <p>Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money, it lies in the joy of achievement, in the
                            thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten
                            in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if
                            they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to
                            ourselves and to our fellow-men.
                        </p>
                        <p>Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand
                            with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are
                            to be values only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit, and there must be
                            an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust
                            the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for
                            it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful
                            protection, on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.
                        </p>
                        <p>Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation asks for action, and
                            action now.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face
                            it wisely and courageously. It can be accompanied in part by direct recruiting by the
                            government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the
                            same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and
                            reorganize the use of our national resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hand in hand with this, we must frankly recognize the over-balance of population in our
                            industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to
                            provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped
                            by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to
                            purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy
                            of the growing loss, through foreclosure, of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped
                            by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand
                            that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief
                            activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by
                            national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications
                            and other utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which
                            it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act, and
                            act quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a
                            return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and
                            credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and
                            there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session
                            detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the
                            several States.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in
                            order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly
                            important, are, to point in time and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound
                            national economy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall
                            spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the
                            emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.
                        </p>
                        <p>The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly
                            nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of
                            the various elements in and parts of the United States ... a recognition of the old and
                            permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to
                            recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will

                        </p>
                        <p>In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor;
                            the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of
                            others; the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his
                            agreements in and with a world of neighbors.
                        </p>
                        <p>If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized
                            before, our interdependence on each other: that we cannot merely take, but we must give as
                            well, that if we are to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to
                            sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline, no progress
                            is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our
                            lives and property to such discipline because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a
                            larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us
                            all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed
                            strife.
                        </p>
                        <p>With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our
                            people, dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have
                            inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is
                            possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without
                            loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most
                            superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress
                            of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world
                            relations.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be
                            wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an
                            unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from
                            that normal balance of public procedure.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation
                            in the midst of a stricken world may require. But in the event that the Congress shall fail
                            to take one of these courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still
                            critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask
                            the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad executive power to
                            wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were
                            in fact invaded by a foreign foe.
                        </p>
                        <p>For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I
                            can do no less.
                        </p>
                        <p>We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity, with the
                            clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values, with the clean satisfaction
                            that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the
                            assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.
                        </p>
                        <p>We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have
                            not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous
                            action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the
                            present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and
                            every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.

                        Despite the election of FDR and all his New Deal programs,
                        unemployment in cities remained high and began to take its
                        toll on society. Unemployed men felt a loss of status because
                        they could not provide for their families. They became easily
                        agitated and irritable which resulted in many fights and
                        quarrels in public places. Women who had jobs suddenly
                        came under immense social pressure to give their jobs to
                        unemployed men. Women were told that men "deserved" the job
                        more than they did. Almost all married women lost their jobs,
                        even if they were the only person in the family working.
                        Women were relegated to servant positions that society saw
                        as more suited to women than men. These jobs usually paid
                        much less than the jobs they had to give up.

                        Children were also put to work. Boys and girls by the
                        hundreds dropped out of school and either began working
                        low-paying jobs or staying home to look after younger
                        siblings while both their parents worked. Teenagers
                        dropped out of school and frequently left their families.
                        Most could not find jobs and their families could not
                        support them. Many city youth ran away from the city and
                        "rode the rails," or roamed the country by railroad. These
                        youth would sneak onto trains, beg for food, and live
                        in <span class="keyword">squatter</span> camps along the railroad routes.

                            Cities were full of unemployed, homeless, starving people
                            who could not find work despite FDR's New Deal programs.
                            This chaos led to food riots and strain on city budgets.
                            Society pressured women out of jobs, children into jobs,
                            and teenagers to ride the rails.

                            The Depression attacked farms as quickly and as
                            destructively as it did the cities. The problems
                            facing farmers were numerous and complex and could
                            not be fixed with a single solution.

                                During the 1920s, farms were prospering and there was
                                such an abundance of rainfall that farmers all across
                                the western United States had become careless in their
                                farming techniques and soil preparation. Farmers
                                over-grazed livestock and over-plowed fields to make
                                more money. This damaged the land and destroyed the
                                regenerative properties of the soil. During the 1930s,
                                there was a large drought in the West, causing crops
                                to shrivel, cattle to die, and the topsoil to blow
                                away. This turned the West into one large
                                <span class="keyword">dust bowl</span>.
                            </p>

                                The states in the dust bowl region were Kansas, Oklahoma,
                                Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. This region was called
                                the dust bowl because of the large numbers of <span class="keyword">dust
                                storms</span> that occurred there. However, other states
                                like Arkansas and the Dakotas were also plagued by dust
                                storms.

                                What is a dust storm? Dust storms are storms that last
                                for several days, driven by high winds. The winds blow
                                dust, creating huge dark, yellowish clouds that, at times,
                                can block out the light of the sun. Sometimes, these dust
                                clouds can get up to 8,000 feet high and be accompanied
                                by thunder and lightning. Two massive and highly
                                destructive dust storms occurred in the 1930s. The first
                                was in May of 1934.

                                A dust storm lasting three days blew across the West
                                and Southwest, pulling up over 350 million tons of soil
                                and dropping it as far east as New York City, New York
                                and Boston, Massachusetts. It was reported that these
                                cities had to turn on streetlamps in the daytime just
                                to be able to see through the blowing dust. The second
                                storm occurred in March of 1935 in the Dakotas and
                                Nebraska. It destroyed the entire wheat crop for both
                                states and swept away as much dirt as workers dug up
                                when they constructed the Panama Canal.

                                Not only were these dust storms economically damaging,
                                they were a danger to the people living in these states.
                                People caught outside in dust storms could suffocate and
                                die from dust inhalation. Because of the havoc these
                                storms wreaked on the land and the people living on it,
                                people were forced to <span class="keyword">migrate</span> to find
                                work or a new place to farm. Many packed up everything
                                they owned into trucks, cars, and wagons and began to
                                travel further west to California and other Pacific States.
                                Over 2.5 million people fled to California during the
                                Great Depression. The migrants began to gather nicknames
                                based on where they were migrating from such as "Oakies"
                                if they were from Oklahoma and "Arkies" if they were
                                from Arkansas. These people pushed west into Texas, Kansas,
                                Nebraska, and the Dakotas, and finding no relief in these
                                dust bowl-burdened states, pushed on to California.

                                Unfortunately, California could not support the huge
                                influx of people that began to pour into the state.
                                California was not a huge farming state, and the small
                                farm towns it did have quickly became overcrowded and
                                overrun with migrants looking for work and land to farm.
                                By 1939, the problem had gotten so bad that the California
                                state government passed a law forbidding entry of any
                                new people into the state. The Supreme Court overturned
                                this law as unconstitutional, and people continued
                                to flood the state.

                                The federal government in the 1930s tried to alleviate
                                the crisis by taking measures to salvage the land that
                                had been destroyed by the dust storms and poor farming
                                techniques. In 1933, the government created the Soil
                                Erosion Service. This was a commission that taught
                                terracing and contour farming techniques to farmers to
                                help them preserve the soil. In 1936, the government
                                passed the Soil Conservation Act, which tried to reduce
                                farm surpluses and promote soil conservation. The
                                government also planted over 200 million trees in
                                the most ravaged parts of the dust bowl from the Dakotas
                                to Texas. These trees took to the soil and began to grow,
                                providing "shelter belts" along the West and conserving
                                water to help hold down the topsoil. The dust bowl was
                                slowly beginning to replenish itself.

                                Aside from the growing dust storms and bad soil, there
                                was another class of farmers affected by the Great
                                Depression. These farmers were tenant farmers or
                                <span class="keyword">sharecroppers</span>. After the Civil War,
                                sharecroppers replaced slaves on many farms. Some
                                sharecroppers were former slaves, while others were
                                poor white farmers. Sharecroppers, or tenant farmers,
                                did not own their land. They were not paid any wages.
                                Someone else owned the land they farmed and the
                                sharecroppers rented it. They paid these landowners
                                with a "share" of the crops and other goods produced
                                on that farm. Most of these farmers could only obtain
                                the seed, food, and clothes they needed each year by
                                pledging their harvest in advance.

                                When the Great Depression hit these farms, not to mention
                                the dust storms, most sharecroppers had already pledged
                                their crops and other goods in advance. The dying crops
                                and bad soil could not produce enough for the farmers
                                to live off of, so they were unable to pay their share
                                to the landowners. As a result, they were forced to
                                leave the land, burdened with huge debts they had no
                                hope of paying.

                                The federal government, again, tried to help, by passing
                                the Federal Emergency Relief Act to help tenant farmers.
                                This act gave money, seeds, and equipment to these farmers
                                and tried to relocate them to better land. It helped
                                some, but not all sharecroppers, escape total poverty.

                                Another major problem that farmers faced during the Great
                                Depression was lack of electricity. Before the depression hit,
                                only one in ten farms had electricity. After the depression
                                and the major dust storms, it became apparent that more
                                farms needed electricity and quickly! So the federal
                                government formed the Rural Electrification Administration
                                to bring electricity to farms in the West. The REA had
                                the power to loan money to farmers and small towns to help
                                them build generators and install power lines. This action
                                was one of the most revolutionary and successful actions
                                during the Great Depression. By 1941, four out of five
                                American farms now had electricity.

                                    Powerful dust storms in the 1930s created a dust bowl
                                    in the middle of the United States. Farmers and their
                                    families were forced to migrate in droves to California
                                    and other points west. Sharecroppers faced debt from
                                    lack of crops, and farms in the West needed electricity.
                                    The federal government set up programs to help, and
                                    were, for the most part, successful.

                                gathered a reputation as an innovative, talented documentary photographer.

                                the homeless men in the cities around the country. One of those photographs, White Angel
                                Breadline, gained the attention of not only her colleagues, but also the federal
                                government. The government hired her to work with the Resettlement Association of the
                                1930s to bring the conditions of the poor to the attention of the public. She traveled
                                with and photographed hundreds of migrant workers. Her photographs directly contributed
                                to the establishment of better housing camps for migrant workers in California.

                                Books, movies, and music were dedicated to bringing up
                                American morale. Most of the books were reality-based books
                                about the state of affairs such as <em>Let Us Now Praise

                                these novels were extremely popular because they told
                                the truth and gave a voice to the people of the nation

                                Movies took a different tack. Some studios projected the
                                image of the ideal life or a hopeful future, such as many
                                of the Shirley Temple movies of the 1930s. Other films
                                were pure escapism, like The Wizard of Oz. People flocked
                                to the movies either to be encouraged by the future or to
                                forget the present.

                                had characters with extraordinary powers that helped
                                the poor, downtrodden, and innocent.

                                The music industry also worked hard to raise people's
                                spirits. Many parlor songs of the time were uplifting,
                                with messages of hope for the future with titles such
                                as "When the Shepherd Leads the Sheep Back Home" (1931)
                                and "The Clouds Will Soon Roll By" (1932). Some songs
                                took on a more humorous and whimsical tone to help
                                refocus people's attention away from the bad times,
                                such as "Here It is Monday and I've Still Got A Dollar"
                                (1932).

                                Other types of entertainment slipped in to help society
                                refocus. In 1930, the first pinball machine hit the scene,
                                and in 1935, Parker Brothers distributed the first version
                                of the board game Monopoly. People took to these
                                distractions, and they helped to pass what was one of
                                the hardest times in American history.

                                    The morale of the American people fell rapidly during
                                    the Great Depression. Books, movies, and music worked
                                    overtime to keep people hopeful and happy. These types
                                    of entertainment gave people hope and joy in a very
                                    tough time.

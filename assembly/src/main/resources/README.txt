------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Command line tool ###

 1. get the short help by running the launcher script 'dp2' on
 Mac/Linux or 'dp2.exe' on Windows from the "cli" directory
 2. run 'dp2 help a-script-name' to get the detailed description of a script
 4. execute a job with the 'dp2 a-script-name' subcommand and specify the
 required options (as given with the 'dp2 help a-script-name' command)

For instance:

	> cli\dp2.exe dtbook-to-zedai --source samples\dtbook\hauy_valid.xml
	--output "C:\Users\John Doe\Desktop\out"


will run the DTBook to ZedAI converter on Windows and will output the result
in the "out" directory on the desktop of the user named "John Doe".


### RESTful Web Service ###

 1. start the web service by running 'bin/pipeline' on Mac/Linux or
 'bin\pipeline.bat' on Windows

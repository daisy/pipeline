# The following property makes specified packages from the class path
# available to all bundles. You should avoid using this property.
#org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=

# Felix tries to guess when to implicitly boot delegate in certain
# situations to ease integration without outside code. This feature
# is enabled by default, uncomment the following line to disable it.
#felix.bootdelegation.implicit=false

# The following property explicitly specifies the location of the bundle
# cache, which defaults to "felix-cache" in the current working directory.
# If this value is not absolute, then the felix.cache.rootdir controls
# how the absolute location is calculated. (See next property)
org.osgi.framework.storage=${felix.cache.rootdir}/felix-cache
# The following property is used to convert a relative bundle cache
# location into an absolute one by specifying the root to prepend to
# the relative cache path. The default for this property is the
# current working directory.
felix.cache.rootdir=${org.daisy.pipeline.data}/felix-cache
# The following property controls whether the bundle cache is flushed
# the first time the framework is initialized. Possible values are
# "none" and "onFirstInit"; the default is "none".
org.osgi.framework.storage.clean=onFirstInit


# The following property specifies the directory to use as the bundle
# auto-deploy directory; the default is 'bundle' in the working directory.
felix.auto.deploy.dir=${bundles.auto.deploy}
# The following property determines which actions are performed when
# processing the auto-deploy directory. It is a comma-delimited list of
# the following values: 'install', 'start', 'update', and 'uninstall'.
# An undefined or blank value is equivalent to disabling auto-deploy
# processing.
felix.auto.deploy.action=install,start


# The following property is a space-delimited list of bundle URLs
# to start when the framework starts. The ending numerical component
# is the target start level. Any number of these properties may be
# specified for different start levels.
# felix.auto.start.5=

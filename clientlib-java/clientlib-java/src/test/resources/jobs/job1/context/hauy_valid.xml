               <sent id="dtb10">Valentin Haüy (1745-1821), of many called the father of the education of the blind, founded a school for blind children of both sexes in Paris in 1785. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb11">In 1786 he published the first known book about education for the blind. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb12">His main idea was the necessity of educating the blind to an independent life. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb13">Thus the blind were trained for different professions such as printing, basket making, sewing etc. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb14">Another of Haüys ideas was that blind children should not be segregated but educated together with sighted children. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb15">His method of printing books with letters in relief and ink-print was a minor revolution that enabled the blind to read books. </sent>
            </p>
            <p>
               <sent id="dtb16">In the study a hitherto unknown period in Haüys life is described. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb17">It is the period 1807-1820 which he spent in St Petersburg, then the capital of Russia. </sent>
               <sent id="dtb18">In the study there is also an analysis of Haüy’s influence on the education of the blind in other European countries. </sent>
